## Ashley Liang


## Overview
This website, after running npm deploy, will deploy to ashleyliang.me. This is a multi-page website that is both computer and laptop friendly. On a computer, you'd see a navigation bar with the different pages listed out. On a mobile device or screen with a smaller window, you'd see a drop-down icon with the different pages listed out there. Overall, this website was a really great process for me to learn React and React/HTML/JS/CSS's different features, try out different front-end skills, implement different APIs (I used leaflet and maptiler to visualize my roadtrip map), and debug using inspect element. The pages folder contains the .js files of the pages in my website, such as homepage.js for the homepage. The components folder contains the navigation bar and sidebar code.

### Credits
While creating this website, I took a lot of information from different website and videos. To set up my React project, I followed the instructions from this website: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-multi-page-website-using-react-js/. I learned how to create the dropdown menu (for mobile) with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl54MJDR2p8&t=4458s. To create the roadtrip map with leaflet, this video was particularly helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9oX1upSKjI&list=PLKmmzLM3RgQVFqnNqn3CI2Cxg4Rd__VbK.

## Favorite Features
- Mobile friendly: sidebar navigation for smaller screen widths, almost every styling is with vw and vh to account for smaller devices
- Roadtrip map (can zoom in and out) with clickable pins that bring up popups with a description of my experience at that stop
- Hyperlinks in the images in the Contact page
- Styling on the homepage
